- [Evaluation](#evaluation)

## Install
Coming soon.

## Myriad Weights
Myriad Weights are coming soon. 

## Demo

The demo code is coming soon.

## Train

Training code is already in the repository. The two stage training guidance will be updated. 

## Evaluation

In Myriad, we evaluate models on the public benchmark for Anomaly Detection, MVTec and VisA. To ensure the reproducibility, we evaluate the models with greedy decoding. We do not evaluate using beam search.

Evaluate code is public now, and the guidance is coming soon in few days.
